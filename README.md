OVERVIEW: 
The Bank Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and enhance the operations of a banking institution. This project aims to provide an efficient and secure platform for managing various banking activities, including customer accounts, transactions, and loan management.

OBJECTIVE:
1.	Efficient management of customer accounts and transactions.
2.	Secure handling of sensitive financial information.
3.	Automation of routine banking processes.
4.	Streamlined loan management within the bank.
5.	User-friendly interface for both customers and bank staff.

METHODOLOGY:
The Bank Management System is developed using Java as the primary programming language and utilizes the Java libraries for the graphical user interface. The backend is powered by a MySQL database to ensure data integrity and security.

The project follows an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, with classes and objects representing real-world entities such as different types of accounts and loans. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram has been updated to reflect the refined design and architecture.

Encapsulation and abstraction are integral OOP principles incorporated in the project. Classes are designed to encapsulate data and behavior, abstraction is used to manage complexity, enhance readability, promote reusability, and facilitate maintenance.
